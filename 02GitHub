    SSH key -> to communicate with our system and github account repo
02. Create a repo on github account
03. perform neccessary operation only
    { echo "# git-github-test" >> README.md
    git init
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin https://github.com/SunilDharawat/git-github-test.git
    git push -u origin main (-u means set a upstream for main branch when next time we push the code to origin it reflect on our origin branch)
    }
    Origin means remote repositry name 
04. to check remote connection we used => git remote -v (this give us to details of connection)
    After add origin cmg we get connetion between our repo and system
    And using this cmd we can fetch or push repositry
